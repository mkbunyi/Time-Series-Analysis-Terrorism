# Time-Series-Analysis-Terrorism

This project was conceived as an experimental exercise seeking to answer if it could at all be possible to find patterns and generate rough forecasts on the occurrence and impact of terrorism. Specifically, I was interested to explore the central research question of whether there were discernible trends, cycles, and/or seasonality in the incidence of terrorist incidents globally.
